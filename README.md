# FEND DOM Manipulation Project

Simple landing page application using plain ES6 javascript and the Model-View-Controller architecture.

## Purpose

Demostrate the usage of DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering page content and constructing navigation bar.

## Author

John Collins

## Notes

Page content data is stored in localStorage to mimick data coming from a remote API. This will be created when application runs for the first time. Also depends on ES6/ESNext support in modern browsers including ES6 modules without the use of Webpack/Babel.
